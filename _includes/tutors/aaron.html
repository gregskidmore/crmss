    Aaron completed his doctoral studies as an organist in the studio of Edoardo Bellotti, having previously studied with Hans Davidsson and Michel Bouvard at
    Eastman, and with Paul Merritt at the University of Western Ontario, where he received the Faculty of Music Gold Medal. His PhD dissertation examined the

    for the religiously divided public of post-Reformation Augsburg. Aaron’s research has been presented at conferences in Canada, the United States, Belgium and the
    United Kingdom, and has been honoured with the Charles Warren Fox Award and the Jerald C. Graue Fellowship; his published musicological work appears in the
    <i>Journal of the Alamire Foundation, Early Music, Sacred Music, Oxford Bibliographies Online</i> and <i>Grove Music Online</i>. He currently serves as a
    Sessional Lecturer in organ at the University of Toronto, having previously taught at Eastman and at the University of Rochester.
