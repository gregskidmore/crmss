  "How exciting to be returning for a third year at CRMSS! It has been a pleasure to see the positive evolution over the last two years and this year's course looks
  to be heading in new directions once again with the vastly experienced and inimitable Robert Hollingworth as CRMSS Guest Artist. I am looking forward to CRMSS 2020
  immensely and am excited to work with more singers on issues relating to solo singing and performance, focussing on the sort of healthy, full, and connected
  singing which should be no barrier to working well within an ensemble, no matter what the repertoire might be."
