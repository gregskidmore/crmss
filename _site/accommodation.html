<p>
  We can present two options for you to choose from, both of which are less than a 10-minute walk from our venue, First-St. Andrew's United Church (FSA). You are
  very welcome to disregard these and arrange your own accommodation, but we have been given special rates, outlined below. If neither of these options are available
  or suit your preferences, we can also look into Airbnbs.
</p>
<p>There is a 4% MAT charge for all stays in London Ontario that last fewer than 30 days. This means that the total tax rate is 17.52%.</p>
<p>
  Another little perk to think about: Tourism London is offering you a $100 Visa gift card with every hotel stay. Both of the hotels listed here are participating in
  the scheme, which is called "Stay A Little Longer".

<p>
  This is the closer of the two options, a 4-minute walk from FSA. It is an independent hotel designed for longer stays. I've been in touch with Ryan Arnezeder, the
  hotel's General Manager, and he's been very helpful in sorting us out with some discounts and special options.
</p>

<p>Here are the basic options to choose from:</p>

<ul class="accommodation-list">
  <li>
<b>Studio:</b> (Queen bed) -- $71 + taxes / night</li>
  <li>
    <b>Double Studio:</b> (Two double beds in one room) -- $71 + taxes / night
    <span class="accommodation-note">This is a <u>very cheap option</u> for people willing to share a room.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
<b>Studio with balcony:</b> (Queen bed)</li>
  <li>
<b>1 Bedroom:</b> (Double bed)</li>
  <li>
<b>1 Bedroom Premium:</b> (King bed)</li>
  <li>
<b>1 Bedroom Deluxe:</b> (King bed with balcony)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is another option that Ryan has suggested to us, which is perhaps the best value of all of these:</p>
<p class="accommodation-quotation">
  "For those traveling under a budget. I do have some un-renovated rooms that I have access to but aren't available to the public. They are original older rooms that
  are clean, but dated. They don't fit our brand yet so we offer them at a supreme discount. These 2 bedroom apartments are equipped with a kitchen, living room,
  dining room, and 2 private bedrooms. Let me know if this is something someone is interested in and I'll send you some photos. We can offer these at
  <u> $50 + taxes / night </u>. There are 4 of these 2-bedroom apartments, but I would need to talk to some of our longer term guests to get a solid idea of
  availability during your course."
</p>
<p>
  These older rooms may in fact be the best option. You would be sharing a suite with another participant but would have your own bedroom. The kitchen and other
  rooms would be shared, including the bathroom.
</p>
<p>Ryan also says:</p>
<p class="accommodation-quotation">
  All of these rooms include private kitchens. We have underground parking for $8 / night and coin-operated laundry facilities on our 2nd floor. We also run a small
  convenience store here and are able to find items if we don't already have them.
</p>
<p class="accommodation-quotation">
  Please forward my email address to anyone who would like to book a room. I'd like to help your group out personally. I have also blocked the hotel for you and will
  hold this until the 26th. After this, I will release the hotel and your request will be subject to availability.
</p>
<p>Ryan can be reached on <a href="mailto:ryan@leshotel.net">ryan@leshotel.net</a></p>
<p>
  If you are interested in one of the shared options, we will coordinate those bookings. Please let Greg Skidmore know (<a href="mailto:info@crmss.org">info@crmss.org</a>) what you decide, even if it is to go it alone and contact Ryan directly.
</p>

<h1 id="residence-inn">Residence Inn by Marriott</h1>

</p>
<p>
  For those of you wanting a little more comfort for a little more cost, Residence Inn by Marriott is about a 7-minute walk from FSA. I've been working with their
  Director of Sales and Marketing, Brent Smith, who has given me a lot of information, including a set of preferential rates just for us.
</p>
<h2>CRMSS Preferred rates</h2>
<p class="accommodation-sub-h2">valid between August 20th and September 10th</p>

<ul class="accommodation-list under-accommodation-sub-h2">
  <li>
<b>Large King Studio Suite</b> -- $109 + taxes / night</li>
  <li>
<b>One Bedroom King Suite</b> -- $119 + taxes / night</li>
  <li>
<b>One Bedroom Queen / Queen Suite</b> -- $129 + taxes / night</li>
  <li>
<b>Two Bedroom 1 Bathroom Suite</b> -- $149 + taxes / night</li>
  <li>
<b>Two Bedroom 2 Bathrooms Suite</b> -- $169 + taxes / night</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2-bedroom suites might be a good option for those wishing to share but who might like a bit more luxury than what's available at London Extended Stay</p>

<p>Some more information:</p>
<ul class="accommodation-list">
  <li>Enhanced health and cleanliness protocols</li>
  <li>All-suite hotel with fully equipped kitchens</li>
  <li>
<b>Free breakfast</b> daily</li>
  <li>Free local calls and <b>complimentary high-speed internet</b>
</li>
  <li>Complimentary business centre</li>
  <li>On site laundry facilities and daily dry-cleaning service</li>
  <li>Opportunity to earn Marriott Bonvoy points</li>
</ul>

<p>Brent sent a link to a virtual tour of one of the rooms:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realbigtours.com/tours/tour.cfm?tourID=4208&amp;statsUpdated=Y&amp;TWH=500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Tour</a></p>

<p>... and finally, here is a link to a PDF that Brent sent with a general overview of the hotel and what it offers:</p>
<p><a href="pdf/ResidenceInn2021Brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Residence Inn by Marriott 2021 Brochure</a></p>

<p>
  Brent mentioned that he can set up a dedicated booking link for us if required. Please either get in touch with him directly on
  <a href="mailto:sales@marriottresidenceinnlondon.com">sales@marriottresidenceinnlondon.com</a> or let Greg Skidmore (<a href="mailto:info@crmss.org">info@crmss.org</a>) know that you'd like to pursue this option.
