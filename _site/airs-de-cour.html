  <h1>Airs de Cour at CRMSS 2021 with Lucas Harris</h1>
</center>

<p>Hello, team CRMSS!</p>
<p>This is Lucas Harris, resident lutenist for CRMSS.</p>
<p>
  I wanted to give some information to those of you who have expressed interest in the solo singing portion of CRMSS. It’s the first time I’m in the position of
  running the program and I’m very excited about it.
</p>
<p>This portion of CRMSS will begin on Monday the 30th, though we may have a meeting before then to talk about the project.</p>
<p>We’re going to dedicate the bulk of the solo singing this year to the early <i>Air de cour</i>.</p>
<p>
  <i>Airs de cour</i> are secular courtly airs published in France between about 1571 to around 1640 or so. There were many, many books of these published, some of
  them in multiple voice parts, some completely monophonic (solo voice with no accompaniment), and some with a lute accompaniment in tablature. It’s this latter
  category we’ll be focused on, and I’ll be everyone’s accompanist.
</p>
<p>Some of the main composers include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adrian Le Roy</li>
  <li>Étienne Moulinié</li>
  <li>Pierre Guédron</li>
  <li>Antoine Boësset</li>
  <li>Gabrielle Bataille</li>
  <li>François de Chancy</li>
  <li>François Richard</li>
  <li>Jean Boyer</li>
  <li>Louis DeMoy</li>
  <li>Louis de Rigaud</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Interestingly, Edward Filmer also published a volume containing some of these airs in English translations:
  <i>French court-aires with their ditties Englished</i> (1629).
</p>
<p>
  Note that there are also later <i>airs de cour</i> with continuo accompaniment by composers such as Lambert, de la Barre, Bacilly, etc. These are really a Baroque
  genre that we’ll leave aside for the purposes of CRMSS.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve always loved these airs and have wanted to explore them more. They have their own sort of appeal: they are based on simple melodies, have a limited vocal
  range, and a somewhat reserved mode of expression without much gut-wrenching harmonic dissonance. The texts tend to be standard courtly fare about unrequited love
  and pastoral romance, etc. And yet, when these airs are sung and accompanied well, they are absolutely mesmerizing, and a reminder that the French aesthetic is
  different. With the right <i>je ne sais quoi</i> in the delivery these can make an audience absolutely swoon.
</p>
<p>The original facsimile editions are beautifully engraved and very inviting. However, there are a few pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of barlines (this has to do with the influence of something called <i>musique mesurée</i>)</li>
  <li>Old spellings</li>
  <li>Lute tablature with no keyboard realization</li>
  <li>
    Also, some of the airs sound a tone lower than they are written. I know that’s a little weird – it has to do with the lute favouring flat keys, but they didn’t
    like to write music yet with more than one flat, so they’d just write it a tone higher and thereby get rid of two flats. You may have to consult a lutenist or a
    recording to know which ones are in this category. (I’ve seen singers be disappointed when they learned they wouldn’t be able to sing their favourite high notes
    as they had supposed.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some (though not all) of these hurdles can be overcome using modern editions, though not all of them have been edited. For a long time, the only modern editions
  that could be found are in an anthology from the 1960s edited by Verchaly, usually findable in university libraries. It’s the sort of volume that often doesn’t
  circulate so might be inaccessible to us right now what, with the university libraries generally having only curbside pickup of circulating materials. It looks
  like a lutenist friend who owns a copy is going to mail it to me in London, so hopefully we’ll have a copy there for our use. He’s scanned a number of airs for us,
  but the image quality I’m afraid isn’t great.
</p>
<p>There are starting to be some more modern editions of these airs now, and even some that are available for free online if you know where to look.</p>
<p>I’ve been gathering some materials for us and putting them in this Google Drive folder:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FPsbjTLYH-17bmo8_b3ES9AJsfe9ZITW?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas' folder of Airs de cour</a></p>
<p>You’ll find a number of sub-folders there, with some modern and facsimile scores. You’ll find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some facsimile scores in the “facsimile” subfolder</li>
  <li>Some modern scores in subfolders organized by composer</li>
  <li>Some entire books of airs edited by a lutenist named Doug Towne, in their own subfolder</li>
  <li>The contents page and some scores (some with very poor image quality) from the Verchaly anthology</li>
  <li>
    The tracks and booklet scan from my favourite early air de cour recording by Suzie le Blanc &amp; Stephen Stubbs, which features the first book of airs by Moulinié.
    Although this CD is dated (1996), in my opinion it’s still pretty tough to beat and a great introduction to this genre. I’d be happy to know if you find any more
    recent recordings of early airs de cour.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Just like the English lute song, where there are literally hundreds of great songs to chose from and we tend to hear the same five or so sung again and again (Flow
  my tears, Come Again, If my Complaints, Never Weather Beaten Sail, etc.), so there are a few “hits” from the Verchaly anthology that tend to get sung nearly every
  time airs de cour are programmed. I would say in my experience these include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moulinié – Enfin la Beauté</li>
  <li>Guédron – Si jamais mon âme blesse</li>
  <li>Guédron – Cessés mortels de soupirer</li>
  <li>Anon – Ma belle si ton ame</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I’d say it would be great if we could avoid these if possible. There are so many others, and I would love to explore them and see if we can find some other gems.
</p>
<p>It’s important that we get translations for any airs you want to work on. Please make one yourself or let me know if I can help you.</p>
<p>
  A big decision in singing these airs is whether to modernize the French pronunciation or sing them with historical pronunciation. Although I love the sound of the
  historical accent and know people who can coach it, I’m not really qualified to coach it myself, so it might be best for us to sing with a modern French accent. If
  you have a resource to help you with historical pronunciation and are keen to do that, let me know. For any of you who are not super comfortable with French in
  general, I’d suggest checking out the Edward Filmer volume mentioned above (it’s in the folder of airs edited by Doug Towne).
</p>
<p>
  I realize that it might be daunting to look at this folder with so many airs. How do you choose one without spending days looking through the materials? While a
  part of me wants to make this easier for you by choosing an air or two for you to learn, I know that I’ll be 1) taking a stab in the dark not knowing you or your
  voice, and 2) very tempted to fall back on pieces I’ve accompanied before. So please accept my challenge that you dive in and just find an air or two that seem
  interesting for whatever reason. It might be that whatever you find may not have been sung since the 17th century, and I find a lot of excitement in that.
</p>
<p>
  If you really don’t know where to start, I’d suggest you listen to some of the Suzie le Blanc recording. Open up the facsimile of the Moulinié book 1 and follow
  along. Choose a piece that seems attractive, and just start learning it! You can find a translation in the scan I made of the CD booklet. Put some extra bar lines
  into the score if you need them. And if you need to underlay the 2nd and 3rd verses, just write out the melody on paper or on a computer and write the new text in
  by hand. These are all things that will really help make whatever piece you choose “yours” and make this a more meaningful experience.
</p>
<p>
  Write to me if you have any questions or concerns (and if you’d like to know if you’ve chosen a piece that will sound a tone lower than it is written – see above).
</p>
<p>
  Note that I’m planning to have two lutes with me – one pitched normally for high voices (sops &amp; tenors) and then my new ‘baritone’ lute for medium voices (mezzos,
  baritones, countertenors) which automatically transposes any song down three additional semitones.
</p>
<p>
  That’s it for now. I’m so looking forward to exploring these airs with you. Without the pressure of a public performance, we’ll have fun experimenting with this
  material.
</p>
<p>All best,</p>
<p>Lucas Harris</p>
