      In memoriam Carol King
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>“Ye sacred Muses,”</i> wrote William Byrd, at the death of his friend, Thomas Tallis, <i>“Come down from
        crystal heav'ns above to earth where sorrow dwelleth.”</i> With the words of her favourite composer, we
      now must mourn the passing of our wonderful alto and tireless supporter, Carol King, without whom the
      Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School would not be what it is. CRMSS participants will remember her
      strength and dedication to the beauty she knew belonged in this world, despite its sorrow. As a fledgling
      organization, we have been buoyed up by Carol and Gerry’s unwavering support and generosity. Now more than
      ever, we are honoured and deeply grateful to have been named a recipient of Carol’s wishes for wider
      support. When we are permitted to sing together again, we will not forget her. We know she is still singing,
      from crystal heav’ns.

    The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School's mission is to promote Renaissance music in Canada, bring
    together people who love it, and to encourage its performance at the highest levels.
  </p>
  <p>We seek to offer high quality musical experiences to everyone who attends our courses and events and, as we
    grow, we want more and more to encourange students and young singers to engage with the music of the
    Renaissance. These are often the people least financially able to travel to our events and afford
    accommodation and we currently work hard to find cost effective options for all our participants. Our tuition
    fees are among the lowest available in North America, even though our tutors are mostly based internationally,
    and we are committed to maintaining these low fees. Your support will help us continue to provide world class
    musical experiences to all.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also wish to add to our offering and diversify the types of events we provide, such as weekend workshops
    held throughout the year, individual public concert projects, and multiple week-long courses held each summer
    throughout Canada.
  </p>
