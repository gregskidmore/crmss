<p>The third Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, directed by Greg Skidmore, will take place in London, Ontario in August and September of 2021.</p>
<p>
  Aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at undergraduate students, graduates, and young professional singers, The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School (CRMSS) is
  dedicated to the study and performance of Renaissance polyphonic vocal music at the highest levels.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  Come and learn from internationally acknowledged specialist tutors from the worlds of performance and academia, and be immersed in this magnificent music for a
  week. It will be an intensive period of rehearsal and performance, both liturgically and in concert, all with an emphasis on quality in performance.
</p>

    Applications for CRMSS 2021 are open! Please click
    <a href="/apply">here</a> to go to the Contact page of this website where you can apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish, you can chat live with us via Facebook Messenger by clicking the red button in the bottom right corner of any page on this website. If we're not
    available immediately, we will get back to you as soon as we can.
  </p>
  <!--
  <p>
    The application deadline is Thursday, July 1st 2021.
  </p>
  -->
  <p>
    While the course is open to everyone aged 19 and over, successful applicants will have a high level of sight reading confidence and some experience with small
    ensemble and one per part a capella singing. Current and recent university music students are especially encouraged to apply and some familiarity with
    Renaissance repertoire will also be an asset. We encourage everyone to apply, though; a major in vocal studies is not a requirement, nor is the completion of
    formal musicological study.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course will be very heavily focussed on performance; we will encounter academic, liturgical, and stylistic questions primarily through our practical
    engagement with the music itself. All that is required is an open mind and an affinity for collaborative ensemble music making.
  </p>

    <h3>FOR MUSIC STUDENTS AT WESTERN UNIVERSITY ONLY</h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    <!-- <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/"><img src="/img/westernlogo2.png" id="western-academic-credit-logo"></a> -->
    We are excited to offer CRMSS participants who are also registered as undergraduate students at the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Wright Faculty of Music at Western University</a>
    a chance to earn an Experiential Learning half credit by attending CRMSS 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those seeking to gain undergraduate academic credit for their time at CRMSS will participate in the same events and have the same opportunities as the rest of
    the participants, and their CRMSS course fee will be the same (see below). However, in order to gain the half credit, they will need to get pre-approval before
    the summer school begins from
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/john-cuciurean.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. J. Cuciurean, Associate Dean (Academic Programs and Admissions)</a>, who will
    provide additional details upon application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eligible students will need to complete and submit some written work. Any interested participants must contact Dr. Cuciurean for more information
    <b><u>before</u></b> CRMSS 2021 begins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate music students at Western are also encouraged to contact
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/catherine-nolan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catherine Nolan, Associate Dean (Graduate Studies)</a>
    for more information on obtaining credit by attending CRMSS 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    This partnership validates our strong academic credentials at The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, while also highlighting the crucial roles rehearsal
    and performance, both in a liturgical context and in concert, play in the study of music from the past. We are excited to welcome Western students onto the
    course in 2021!

  <a class="back-to-top" onclick="javascript:ScrollToTop();">Back to top</a>

  <h3>Cost</h3>
  <p>
    The course fee for CRMSS 2021 is <b>$475</b>. This is a decrease from the tuition cost of CRMSS 2019. This covers more than 35 hours of ensemble and individual
    coaching over the course of just over 7 days, participation in lectures and panel discussions led by our resident musicologist tutors, attendance and
    participation in masterclasses and private recitals, and musical scores (many of which will be newly edited) which are yours to keep after the course finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Successful applicants will be asked to provide a deposit of
    <b>$150</b> before the course begins to secure their place. This will be counted against the total course fee, the remainder of which will be due later. Once
    fees are paid, CRMSS reserves the right to limit any refund, taking into account the individual circumstances of a participant's cancellation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lutenists wishing to attend <b>CRMSS 2021 Lute Day</b> will pay a tuition fee of <b>$100</b>. You can find out more about Lute Day by reading our
    <a href="/course">course description</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Accommodation</h3>

  <p>
    Accommodation costs are not included in the course fee. We can, however, arrange accommodation for participants who can chose from a range of options. Please
    have a look at our <a href="/accommodation">accommodation</a> page to see what is available for CRMSS 2021.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participants may also arrange and pay for accommodation entirely on their own, but transport between your accommodation and the course venues will not be
    supplied by CRMSS.
  </p>

  <h3>Travel</h3>
  <p>
    Travel to London, Ontario is your responsibility. Once you have arrived for the course, if you've come by public transport, we will make sure you get to where
    you need to go.

    you the opportunity to get a feel for what happened at CRMSS that year. Please give them a read, and
