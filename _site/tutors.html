  Born in Canada, Greg Skidmore arrived in England as an undergraduate at Royal Holloway College, University of London. After graduating with First Class Honours in
  Music, his post-graduate Choral Scholarship at Wells Cathedral lead him to Lay Clerkships at Gloucester Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. He now
  lives in London, England and pursues a varied career as a consort, choral, and solo oratorio singer alongside his burgeoning work as a conductor and workshop
  leader.
</p>
<p>
  Greg is one of the UK's most sought after consort singers. He has appeared with The Tallis Scholars, The Sixteen, The Cardinall's Musick, Tenebrae, The Gabrieli
  Consort, Alamire, Contrapunctus, The Eric Whitacre Singers, Collegium Vocale Ghent, Cappella Amsterdam, and La Grand Chapelle (based in Madrid). He can be heard on
  discs released by Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, and Harmonia Mundi USA, including Alamire’s recent Grammophone Early Music Award winning disc, ‘The Spy’s Choirbook’.
  In 2015, he featured in I Fagiolini’s <i>Betrayal</i>, a fully staged, devised presentation of the madrigals and sacred music of Carlo Gesualdo. 2017, the 450th
  anniversary of Monteverdi’s birth, was a busy year for I Fagiolini, and Greg performed many concerts of Monteverdi’s madrigals and sacred music, toured a new CD
  release, and performed his opera <i>L'Orfeo</i> this year with the group. 2019 saw Greg take part in an extensive tour of I Fagiolini’s
  <i>Leonardo: Shaping the Invisible</i> project, in collaboration with Dr Martin Kemp, a leading scholar on the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci.
</p>
<p>
  Greg also works as a soloist. Solo engagements have included working with ballet dancer Carlos Acosta in his A Classical Farewell at the Royal Albert Hall in
  London, England; Handel’s Messiah with the Irish Baroque Orchestra; Purcell’s Ode for St Cecilia's Day with the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment;
  Purcell's Fairy Queen with the Gabrieli Consort; and Monterverdi’s 1610 Vespers at the Brighton Early Music Festival, and with I Fagiolini and the BBC Singers at
  the Barbican Centre. His solo recording debut, released in 2011, was as Christus on Ex Cathedra’s recording of the Lassus St. Matthew Passion and a recent Ex
  Cathedra CD release of Alec Roth’s oratorio <i>A Time to Dance</i>
  features Greg in a role written for him.
</p>
<p>
  While at Christ Church in Oxford, he began a course of doctoral research in Musicology at the University of Oxford and started his own men’s voices consort, I
  Dedicati. Recently he was appointed Musical Director of The Lacock Scholars and gives a regular series of concerts with them, creating site-specific evenings that
  weave polyphonic music with plainsong and silence. He has given workshops and masterclasses in the UK, France, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Australia
  in association with The Sixteen, I Fagiolini, and on his own, specialising in various collections of Renaissance polyphonic repertoire. In 2015, Greg joined the
  long list of distinguished Early Music conductors associated with the week-long Lacock Courses held in the UK and around Europe, and joined Eamonn Dougan,
  Associate Conductor of The Sixteen, to lead a course on Polish Renaissance polyphony in August 2017. In August 2018, he assisted Justin Doyle, Chief Conductor of
  RIAS Kammerchor (Berlin) in leading another of these courses. He is increasingly engaged in Canada as a guest conductor, clinician, and record producer. He has
  been published in Early Music and his writing has appeared in programmes and CD liner notes for The Tallis Scholars, The Sixteen, The Cardinall’s Musick, The
  Gabrieli Consort, Tenebrae, and Ex Cathedra.

  "We're back!! After what can only be described as a horrible year, in so many ways, I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to CRMSS 2021. The urgency we all
  feel to get back to singing and to this profoundly wonderful music means CRMSS 2021 will undoubtedly be even more of a hot-house atmosphere this time and I can't
  wait. The fact that we're also marking 500 years since the death of Josquin des Prez, one of the great founding fathers of Renaissance polyphony, means this year
  will be so special. Please come and join us!"

  <!-- Text goes below here -->
  Before teaching Music History at Western University, Kate held a two-year post-doctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of
  Canada (SSHRC) at the University of Toronto, researching musical notation in the 12 th and 13 th centuries. Her doctoral research focused on Gregorian chant
  transmission, orally and through the earliest notated books. She has published articles in Plainsong and Medieval Music, Acta Musicologica, the Journal of the
  Alamire Foundation, SPECTRUM, and Early Music.
</p>
<p>
  She has been a researcher with many projects around the world including Portugal, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, as well as here at home in Canada; usually, her role
  focuses on connecting the musicological 'dots' with the technological tools now available to researchers in the Humanities. She is currently involved in
  developing software and analytics for medieval musical document analysis and chant melody comparisons on a large scale, in several SSHRC-supported projects. She
  sings professionally with the Tafelmusik Chamber Choir, in Toronto.
</p>

<p>
  Kate will be able to help those students interested in receiving the academic credit offered by the Don Wright Faculty of Music at Western University, which is for
  Western music students only. You should <a target="_blank" href="mailto:kate.helsen@uwo.ca">contact her directly</a> if you wish to know more about this.
</p>

<p class="tutor-quotation-head">Kate says:</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "I love that this week offers an opportunity to make quality music in intelligent and beautiful ways, connecting the throat with both the heart and the mind.
  Through singing, conversation, and friendship, we can liberate Renaissance polyphony from the 'imaginary museum of musical works', and experience them from the
  inside.
</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  We were so excited to welcome you back for CRMSS 2020 before, well, you know... Having struggled to make whatever music has been possible under the circumstances
  for the last year, as I know you have too, I can tell you that I dream every day about the glorious sounds we made during CRMSS 2018 and 2019. To say, "looking
  forward to CRMSS 2021" doesn't even begin to cover it!"

  Lucas Harris discovered the lute during his undergraduate studies at Pomona College, where he graduated summa cum laude. He then studied early music in Italy at
  the Civica scuola di musica di Milano (as a scholar of the Marco Fodella Foundation) and then in Germany at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen. After several years
  in New York City, he moved to Toronto in 2004 and became the regular lutenist for the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra. He is a founding member of the Toronto Continuo
  Collective, the Vesuvius Ensemble, and the Lute Legends Ensemble. Lucas plays with many other ensembles in Canada and the USA, including the Helicon Foundation
  (New York) and the Smithsonian Chamber Players (Washington, D.C.). He coaches singers and instrumentalists at the Tafelmusik Summer and Winter Baroque Institutes
  and Oberlin Conservatory’s Baroque Performance Institute, and was an accompanist, coach, and lecturer for Vancouver Early Music’s Baroque Vocal Programme. In 2014
  Lucas completed graduate studies in choral conducting at the University of Toronto, the degree having been funded by a prestigious SSHRC research grant not often
  awarded to performers. Upon graduating, Lucas was chosen as the Artistic Director of the Toronto Chamber Choir, for which he has created and conducted over a dozen
  themed concert programs. He has also directed projects for the Pacific Baroque Orchestra, the Ohio State University Opera Program, Les voix baroques, and the
  Toronto Consort. Lucas was praised for his work with Les voix humaines in Montréal: “The revelation of the concert was the Torontonian lutenist Lucas Harris, who
  weaved a poetic thread through his infinitely subtle interventions. The sweetness and patience of his playing . . . was astonishing.” (Le Devoir)
</p>

<p class="tutor-quotation-head">Lucas says:</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "Live ensemble singing and playing is something I’ll never take for granted again. I think all the pent-up enthusiasm we had for the cancelled CRMSS 2020 will be
  channelled straight into making CRMSS 2021 the best Renaissance workshop North America has ever seen. I’m especially excited that we’re moving forward with
  incorporating a LUTE mini-workshop into CRMSS. As the world emerges from this pandemic, people will need to find joy and love through listening to live music, and
  I’d like us musicians to be ready to deliver that. I can’t wait to see you there!"
