    <p><b>The Tallis Scholars, I Fagiolini, Alamire, The Gabrieli Consort, Eric Whitacre Singers</b></p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/greg.jpg" class="imgLeftAlign" data-featherlight="/img/greg.jpg" loading="lazy">
  <!-- Text goes below here -->
  Born in Canada, Greg Skidmore arrived in England as an undergraduate at Royal Holloway College, University of London. After graduating with First Class Honours in
  Music, his post-graduate Choral Scholarship at Wells Cathedral lead him to Lay Clerkships at Gloucester Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. He now
  lives in London, England and pursues a varied career as a consort, choral, and solo oratorio singer alongside his burgeoning work as a conductor and workshop
  leader.
</p>
<p>
  Greg is one of the UK's most sought after consort singers. He has appeared with The Tallis Scholars, The Sixteen, The Cardinall's Musick, Tenebrae, The Gabrieli
  Consort, Alamire, Contrapunctus, The Eric Whitacre Singers, Collegium Vocale Ghent, Ensemble L'Arpeggiata, Cappella Amsterdam, and La Grand Chapelle (based in
  Madrid). He can be heard on discs released by Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, and Harmonia Mundi USA, including recent Grammophone Early Music Award winning recordings
  with Alamire (‘The Spy’s Choirbook’) and The Tallis Scholars (‘Missa Hercules Dux Ferrarie, Missa D'ung aultre amer &amp; Missa Faysant regretz’). In 2015, he featured
  in I Fagiolini’s <i>Betrayal</i>, a fully staged, devised presentation of the madrigals and sacred music of Carlo Gesualdo. 2017, the 450th anniversary of
  Monteverdi’s birth, was a busy year for I Fagiolini, and Greg performed many concerts of Monteverdi’s madrigals and sacred music, toured a new CD release, and
  performed his opera <i>L'Orfeo</i> this year with the group. 2019 saw Greg take part in an extensive tour of I Fagiolini’s
  <i>Leonardo: Shaping the Invisible</i> project, in collaboration with Dr Martin Kemp, a leading scholar on the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci. In 2020 and 2021,
  he featured in all of the Voces8 LiveFromLondon festivals, with I Fagiolini and the Voces8 Foundation Choir.
</p>
<p>
  Greg also works as a soloist. Solo engagements have included working with ballet dancer Carlos Acosta in his A Classical Farewell at the Royal Albert Hall in
  London, England; Handel’s Messiah with the Irish Baroque Orchestra; Purcell’s Ode for St Cecilia's Day with the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment;
  Purcell's Fairy Queen with the Gabrieli Consort; and Monterverdi’s 1610 Vespers at the Brighton Early Music Festival, and with I Fagiolini and the BBC Singers at
  the Barbican Centre. His solo recording debut, released in 2011, was as Christus on Ex Cathedra’s recording of the Lassus St. Matthew Passion and a recent Ex
  Cathedra CD release of Alec Roth’s oratorio <i>A Time to Dance</i> features Greg in a role written for him.
</p>
<p>
  While at Christ Church in Oxford, he began a course of doctoral research in Musicology at the University of Oxford and started his own men’s voices consort, I
  Dedicati. Recently he was appointed Musical Director of Brighton Consort and in 2014 he founded The Lacock Scholars. He has given workshops and masterclasses in
  the UK, France, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Australia in association with The Sixteen, I Fagiolini, and on his own, specialising in various
  collections of Renaissance polyphonic repertoire. Greg has assisted Eamonn Dougan, Associate Conductor of The Sixteen, and Justin Doyle, Chief Conductor of RIAS
  Kammerchor (Berlin) in leading week-long singing courses specialising in early music and vocal chamber music. He is increasingly engaged in Canada as a guest
  conductor, clinician, and record producer. He has been published in Early Music and his writing has appeared in programmes and CD liner notes for The Tallis
  Scholars, The Sixteen, The Cardinall’s Musick, The Gabrieli Consort, Tenebrae, and Ex Cathedra.

<p class="tutor-quotation-head">Greg says:</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "After so much disruption, uncertainty, disappointment, and struggle over the last two years, I cannot tell you how much I'm looking forward to CRMSS 2022, our
  first chance at hopefully having a 'normal' CRMSS again. CRMSS 2021 was a really special experience, but a unique one and I can't wait to get back to how things
  were, or as close to it as possible. I know that with Robert Hollingworth coming that we're all in for such a treat. Please join us!"

  Robert Hollingworth is passionate about presenting music to audiences in innovative ways. He founded I Fagiolini in 1986; with them he has presented signature
  projects including <i>Simunye, The Full Monteverdi, Tallis in Wonderland, How Like An Angel</i> (with Australian contemporary circus group C!RCA) for the 2012
  Cultural Olympiad, <i>Betrayal: a polyphonic crime drama</i>, and <i>Leonardo: Shaping the Invisible</i> with Professor Martin Kemp for Da Vinci 2019. A year-long
  celebration of the Monteverdi 450th anniversary in 2017 featured performances of <i>Flaming Heart, 1610 Vespers, The Other Vespers</i>, and <i>L'Orfeo</i> at
  venues including Glyndebourne, Cadogan Hall in London for the BBC Proms, and Queen's Hall as part of the Edinburgh International Festival.
</p>
<p>
  Under Hollingworth’s expert direction, I Fagiolini has gone on to win the Royal Philharmonic Society's Ensemble Award, a Gramophone Award and the Diapason D'Or de
  l'Anné. Recent releases on DECCA Classics include the multi-award winning recordings <i>Striggio: Mass in 40 Parts, Amuse-Bouche</i>, and
  <i>Monteverdi: The Other Vespers</i>. In 2019, I Fagiolini released <i>Leonardo: Shaping the Invisible</i> on the CORO label, a programme celebrating the 500th
  anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death in music and image. I Fagiolini toured this programme extensively in 2019 in association with leading da Vinci expert
  Professor Martin Kemp.
</p>
<p>
  Robert has directed the English Concert, Academy of Ancient Music, BBC Concert Orchestra; and some of the world's finest chamber choirs including Accentus, NDR
  Chor, Netherlands Chamber Choir, National Chamber Choir of Ireland and BBC Singers. Last season he conducted De Profundis on their latest album, an exploration of
  the rarely performed Spanish master Vivanco’s <i>Missa Assumpsit Jesus &amp; motets</i>, for Hyperion.
</p>
<p>
  Robert has recently conducted projects with Capella Cracoviensis, RIAS Kammerchor, VOCES8 &amp; VOCES8 Scholars with Academy of Ancient Music in Bach's
  <i>Actus Tragicus</i> and Duruflé's <i>Requiem</i>, completed a tour of Handel's <i>Messiah</i> with Irish Baroque Orchestra, and journeyed to Perth,
  Australia where he was Keynote Presenter at the Australian National Choral Association's ChoralFest 2019. He gave the world premiere of Benji Merrison’s new piece,
  <i>xoxvx ovoid</i>, with the National Youth Choir of Great Britain at the Aldeburgh Proms. This season, Robert returns to Berlin twice to conduct RIAS Kammerchor:
  first in a programme of Purcell as part of the Barocktage Festival collaboration with Staatsoper, and later to work with them on Orazio Vecchi’s
  <i>L'Amfiparnaso</i>. Robert makes his Russian debut as part of the British Council's 'UK-Russia Year of Music' conducting Blow's <i>Venus and Adonis</i> featuring
  Anna Dennis and Jonathan Sells alongside Russian choir Intrada and Pratum Integrum.
</p>
<p>
  Robert has been appointed Artistic Director of Stour Music festival from 2020, succeeding Mark and Alfred Deller. He regularly writes and presents programmes for
  BBC Radio 3, television, and other media outlets. He is Reader in Music at the University of York, where he founded and continues to lead the MA in Solo Voice
  Ensemble Singing course and directs university chamber choir 'The 24'.
</p>

<p class="tutor-quotation-head">Robert says:</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "If you sing Renaissance music, you probably don't need me to explain why you should come. You already know some of the sound worlds - the plangency, the thrill up
  your spine when you get the chord exactly in the right place. The world we recreate when we sing this stuff is alive and vibrant - about the closest we'll ever get
  to time travel. All we hope to do on this course is help you to do it better and with these tutors, (to quote Captain Kirk) 'we have the technology'."

  Lucas Harris discovered the lute during his undergraduate studies at Pomona College, where he graduated summa cum laude. He then studied early music in Italy at
  the Civica scuola di musica di Milano (as a scholar of the Marco Fodella Foundation) and then in Germany at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen. After several years
  in New York City, he moved to Toronto in 2004 and became the regular lutenist for the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra. He is a founding member of the Toronto Continuo
  Collective, the Vesuvius Ensemble, and the Lute Legends Ensemble. Lucas plays with many other ensembles in Canada and the USA, including the Helicon Foundation
  (New York) and the Smithsonian Chamber Players (Washington, D.C.). He coaches singers and instrumentalists at the Tafelmusik Summer and Winter Baroque Institutes
  and Oberlin Conservatory’s Baroque Performance Institute, and was an accompanist, coach, and lecturer for Vancouver Early Music’s Baroque Vocal Programme. In 2014
  Lucas completed graduate studies in choral conducting at the University of Toronto, the degree having been funded by a prestigious SSHRC research grant not often
  awarded to performers. Upon graduating, Lucas was chosen as the Artistic Director of the Toronto Chamber Choir, for which he has created and conducted over a dozen
  themed concert programs. He has also directed projects for the Pacific Baroque Orchestra, the Ohio State University Opera Program, Les voix baroques, and the
  Toronto Consort. Lucas was praised for his work with Les voix humaines in Montréal: “The revelation of the concert was the Torontonian lutenist Lucas Harris, who
  weaved a poetic thread through his infinitely subtle interventions. The sweetness and patience of his playing . . . was astonishing.” (Le Devoir)
</p>

<p class="tutor-quotation-head">Lucas says:</p>
<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "My favourite aspect of playing, singing, studying, and listening to Renaissance music is the sense of mystery I always feel. The musicians and composers from that
  time, in spite of not having so many comforts and conveniences that we enjoy, achieved something that today we’re still trying to understand. Spending a week
  coming together with others who want to understand this music better as I do has been a truly joyful experience during CRMSS in 2018, 2019, and 2021. I’m so
  looking forward to the focus on Iberian music in CRMSS 2022 and am greatly honoured to be a part of this faculty."

  Singer (and player of the viola da gamba and <i>nyckelharpa</i>) Katherine Hill first developed a keen interest in the interaction between older European text and
  music as a teenager in Toronto, singing Gregorian chant and Renaissance polyphony in various choirs and ensembles. With support from the Canada Council for the
  Arts she moved to the Netherlands in the year 2000, pursuing studies, all over Europe, in as many facets as possible of historical performance practices of the
  Middle Ages, Renaissance and early Baroque, very intentionally seeking out and building a natural, vibrant and sustainable singing technique for rhetorical music.
  Over the last 20 years, Katherine has performed, recorded and toured with many early music groups, including the Sequentia Ensemble for Medieval Music, Scivias
  (Berlin), Ars Choralis Coeln, ensemble nu:n, Cappella Amsterdam, Collegium Vocale Ghent, Early Music Voices Calgary, and Ensemble Les Fumeux (Montréal).
</p>
<p>
  Katherine is currently a co-artistic director of the Toronto Consort and is the Cantrix and Director of Music at the Anglo-Catholic parish of St Bartholomew,
  Regent Park, where she directs a mixed choir (that sings primarily 16th century liturgical music) and also a women’s choir, <i>Vinea</i> (specializing in music
  from women’s communities before the year 1500). In 2010, she completed an M.A. in Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto’s world-renowned Centre for
  Medieval Studies, and works regularly as a singing teacher and vocal coach in Toronto, particularly in historical theatre projects at Glendon College (York
  University).

  Sharang is presently the Choral Music Director at Huron University College in London, Ontario. He regularly performs with ensembles in Canada, and has been an
  active musician in the UK before coming to Huron. Sharang received a Bachelor of Music degree from Western University and went on to study historical musicology at
  Oriel College, University of Oxford. While lay clerk at The Queen’s College, Sharang sang with numerous Oxford- and London-based ensembles, e.g. the Academy of
  Ancient Music, and Instruments of Time and Truth, and the BBC. He has built his choral and operatic repertoire through performances with The Strand Consort, Fount
  &amp; Origin, Spectra Ensemble, King’s College London Chapel Choir, as well as semi-professional and amateur choral societies in the UK.
</p>
<p>
  In Canada, Sharang has been engaged in choral work at various cathedrals, chapels, parishes, and colleges, all of which have prepared him for a life in
  ecclesiastical music. He has performed with ensembles like Kammerchor, Chor Amica, UWOpera, and Western University Faculty of Music choirs, and is the current
  James T. Chestnutt Choral Conducting Scholar with the Elmer Iseler Singers. He has also premiered music by established and budding composers in Canada, the UK, and
  the USA. Sharang has co-edited Nota Bene: Canadian Undergraduate Journal of Musicology, and presented his research at GAMuT (University of North Texas) and Oriel
  Talks (Oriel College, Oxford).
</p>
<p>
  At Huron, Sharang is working to incorporate his interest in medieval plainchant with his choral experience as part of a "medium-scale" experiment that seeks to
  answer: can the average 20-year-old student somehow relate to the average 1000-year-old plainchant? He will be delighted to talk to you about his thoughts on
  music's transcendental quality, and his experience with the sound of "beautiful singing" surpassing the implicit boundaries that lie between the different cultures
  of a multicultural world. Having been at every session of the Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, he understands that many of his questions are highly
  relevant at CRMSS. Sharang is thrilled to be back yet again!

  others. In addition to historical-based repertoire, Terry welcomes opportunities to perform contemporary scores by composers such as James Rolfe, Omar Daniel,
  Peter Hannan, John Beckwith and Harry Freedman. Terry has participated on many recordings and broadcasts and finally did his own feature project, Throw the House
  Out of the Windowe (and Other Damn Fine Dance Tunes) on the Marquis Classics label. Another one is in the works – stay tuned! (Other notable recordings are
  Joyner's Dream, Sylvia Tyson; Secret Fires of Love, Studio Rhetorica; The Italian Queen of France, Toronto Consort)Terry gets great satisfaction from teaching

  2022 marks the introduction of the
  <b>CRMSS International Scholars</b> programme. Each year, we will welcome a group of student singers from outside Canada, starting with the United Kingdom. They
  will come as a pre-formed group, who know one another and have worked together before, and will share their talents and experience with the rest of the CRMSS
  participants over the course of the week. They will act as leaders within the larger singing groups, and participate in the small group sessions in amongst the
  Canadian participants, as well as have some time to rehearse on their own.
</p>
<p>
  To begin, we are pleased to welcome all five current students studying for a master's degree in Music at the University of York, in the UK, enrolled in York's
  "Solo Voice Ensemble Singing" MA pathway (known as SVES). This is a course of performance-based master's level study dedicated entirely to one-per-part ensemble
  singing. The programme lasts one year and includes daily rehearsing and coaching, three major recitals, and opportunities to perform with all of the University of
  York's many other singing groups.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on SVES, please have a look at the

<p>Isabelle Palmer, soprano<br>Sarah Keating, soprano<br>Rachel Singer, alto<br>Josh Adams, tenor<br>T. J. Callahan, bass</p>
<p>
  <b>Isabelle Palmer</b> is a soprano graduate of Royal Holloway, University of London, where she held a choral scholarship from 2016-19. A current choral scholar of
  the HeartEdge Foundation, Manchester and Genesis Sixteen alumnus, she is now studying for her MA at the University of York. She enjoys performing a wide variety of
  repertoire, from French chansons to Baroque cantatas, but her primary passion lies with music of the Renaissance. When she isn’t singing she can usually be found
  reading, writing and getting far too excited about dogs.

<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "There is something so distinctly magical about the music of the Renaissance. A week filled with choral, consort and solo rehearsals on repertoire from this
  period, plus a gentle sprinkling of candlelit compline services and keynote lectures sounds like an absolute treat!"

<p class="tutor-quotation">
  "I'm so excited to be a part of CRMSS 2022. I've done a couple of Renaissance singing courses before, and there's really nothing better than getting together with
  other nerds and making music nonstop for a week. It's especially important for me as an American to have access to a course of such high caliber so close to home."
