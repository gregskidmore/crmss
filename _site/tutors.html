        <p><b>The Tallis Scholars, I Fagiolini, Alamire, The Gabrieli Consort, Eric Whitacre Singers</b></p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/greg.jpg" class="imgLeftAlign" data-featherlight="/img/greg.jpg" loading="lazy"> Born in Canada, Greg Skidmore
          arrived in England as an
          undergraduate at Royal Holloway College, University of London. After graduating with First Class Honours in
          Music, his post-graduate Choral
          Scholarship at Wells Cathedral lead him to Lay Clerkships at Gloucester Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral
          in Oxford. He now lives in London, England and pursues a varied career as a consort, choral, and solo oratorio
          singer alongside his
          burgeoning work as a conductor and workshop leader.
        </p>
        <p>Greg is one of the UK's most sought after consort singers. He has appeared with The Tallis Scholars, The
          Sixteen, The Cardinall's Musick, Tenebrae, The Gabrieli Consort, Alamire, Contrapunctus, The Eric Whitacre
          Singers, Collegium Vocale Ghent,
          Cappella Amsterdam, and La Grand Chapelle (based in Madrid). He can be heard on discs released by Decca,
          Deutsche Grammophon, and Harmonia Mundi USA, including Alamire’s recent Grammophone Early Music Award winning
          disc, ‘The Spy’s Choirbook’.
          In 2015, he featured in I Fagiolini’s <i>Betrayal</i>, a fully staged, devised presentation of the madrigals
          and sacred music of Carlo Gesualdo. 2017, the 450th anniversary of Monteverdi’s birth, was a busy year for I
          Fagiolini, and Greg performed
          many concerts of Monteverdi’s madrigals and sacred music, toured a new CD release, and performed his opera
          <i>L'Orfeo</i> this year with the group. 2019 saw Greg take part in an extensive tour of I Fagiolini's
          <i>Leonardo: Shaping the Invisible</i> project, in collaboration with Dr Martin Kemp, a leading scholar on the
          life and art of Leonardo da Vinci.
        </p>
        <p>Greg also works as a soloist. Solo engagements have included working with ballet dancer Carlos Acosta in his
          A Classical Farewell at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England; Handel’s Messiah with the Irish Baroque
          Orchestra; Purcell’s Ode for
          St Cecilia's Day with the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment; Purcell's Fairy Queen with the Gabrieli
          Consort; and Monterverdi’s 1610 Vespers at the Brighton Early Music Festival, and with I Fagiolini and the BBC
          Singers at the Barbican
          Centre. His solo recording debut, released in 2011, was as Christus on Ex Cathedra’s recording of the Lassus
          St. Matthew Passion and a recent Ex Cathedra CD release of Alec Roth’s oratorio <i>A Time to Dance</i>
          features Greg in a role written
          for him.
        </p>
        <p>While at Christ Church in Oxford, he began a course of doctoral research in Musicology at the University of
          Oxford and started his own men’s voices consort, I Dedicati. Recently he was appointed Musical Director of The
          Lacock Scholars and gives
          a regular series of concerts with them, creating site-specific evenings that weave polyphonic music with
          plainsong and silence. He has given workshops and masterclasses in the UK, France, Canada, New Zealand, the
          Netherlands, and Australia in
          association with The Sixteen, I Fagiolini, and on his own, specialising in various collections of Renaissance
          polyphonic repertoire. In 2015, Greg joined the long list of distinguished Early Music conductors associated
          with the week-long Lacock
          Courses held in the UK and around Europe, and joined Eamonn Dougan, Associate Conductor of The Sixteen, to
          lead a course on Polish Renaissance polyphony in August 2017. In August 2018, he assisted Justin Doyle, Chief
          Conductor of RIAS Kammerchor
          (Berlin) in leading another of these courses. He is increasingly engaged in Canada as a guest conductor,
          clinician, and record producer. He has been published in Early Music and his writing has appeared in
          programmes and CD liner notes for The
          Tallis Scholars, The Sixteen, The Cardinall’s Musick, The Gabrieli Consort, Tenebrae, and Ex Cathedra.</p>

        <p class="tutorquotation">
          "We're back!! After what can only be described as a horrible year, in so many ways, I can't tell you
          how much I'm looking forward to CRMSS 2021. The urgency we all feel to get back to singing and to this
          profoundly wonderful music means CRMSS 2021 will undoubtedly be even more of a hot-house atmosphere this time
          and I can't wait. The fact that we're also marking 500 years since the death of Josquin des Prez, one of the
          great founding fathers of Renaissance polyphony, means this year will be so special. Please come and join us!"

        <p>
          <img src="/img/emily.jpg" class="imgRightAlign" data-featherlight="/img/emily.jpg" loading="lazy"> Emily Atkinson studied
          singing and percussion at the Crane
          School of Music, State University of New York, Potsdam, where she earned a degree in music education. Since
          moving to London to train
          at the Royal College of Music, she has enjoyed singing as a soloist and consort singer with many groups, and
          has sung regularly with the Tallis Scholars for the past four years.
        </p>
        <p>Emily grew up as one of nine children in a family that travelled and moved frequently, always making music
          together, so touring with the members of the Tallis Scholars has felt like home in many ways. She feels lucky
          to have performed with the
          group across four continents, singing some of the most beautiful music in the world's greatest venues.</p>
        <p>In addition to singing with the Tallis Scholars, Emily has appeared with The Cardinall's Musick, the Academy
          of Ancient Music, and the Taverner Consort. She loves living in a city with so much early music history, and
          the unique opportunities
          this has provided, from giving illustrative recitals and talks to tour groups at Handel's former residence in
          London to performing excerpts from Restoration-era masques at the Banqueting House of Whitehall Palace where
          they were first performed.
          Emily has sung solo-voice performances of more than fifty Bach cantatas in the liturgical context for which
          they were written, and has recorded a CD of Italian solo cantatas. Emily combines her busy performing career
          with work teaching primary
          school music classes, leading workshops for children, and mentoring new music teachers.</p>

        <p class="tutorquotation">
          I loved being part of this whirlwind week of music-making at both CRMSS 2018 and 2019. Each participant
          brought something special to the course, and it was inspiring to see the level of dedication, energy, and love
          for the music evident in everyone who
          attended. I'm really looking forward to working with singers on this course again next year, as we explore
          even more stunning Renaissance music.

          <img src="/img/matthew.jpg" class="imgLeftAlign"> Matthew Long was a successful treble soloist, singing the role of Miles in Britten’s Turn of the Screw for Italian Opera houses. He studied music at the University of York and sang as a choral
          scholar in the choir of York Minster during his time there. He later won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, London. Whilst there he was a Susan Chilcott Scholar and a Royal Philharmonic Society Young Artist. At various times, he has
          been a member of the celebrated chamber choirs, The Sixteen and Tenebrae and continues to sing as a part of the solo voice ensemble, I Fagiolini.</p>
        <p>Matthew has appeared as a soloist with many UK based ensembles, including The OAE, The English Concert, The Hanover Band, The Dunedin Consort, The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and the LPO. Highlights have included Bach, St. Matthew Passion for
          the Boston Handel and Haydn Society; Britten, War Requiem for Jonathan Willcocks in Salisbury Cathedral. In 2017 he performed the title role in Monteverdi’s Orfeo to critical acclaim in a series of semi-staged productions in Norway and the UK
          with I Fagiolini. Further performances are planned in York and London in 2019. In December 2017, Matthew sang the Evangelist for three concerts of Bach’s, Christmas Oratorio with the Danish Radio Choir in Copenhagen. He is increasingly known
          as a Monteverdi specialist, regularly performing the 1610 Vespers, most notably for the national youth choirs of Great Britain at the Albert Hall, London and at the Osaka Jo hall, Japan with the Berlin RIAS Kammerchor. He appears as tenor soloist
          on the Dunedin Consort’s 2017 recording of the same piece.</p>
        <p>Matthew’s debut solo disc with the LPO and accompanist Malcolm Martineau, Till the Stars Fall, was released in 2015. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios, gems from the English song repertoire sit alongside folk songs in celebration of some of Britain’s
          finest music. He performed this programme in May 2018 as part of the “Music in the Cotswolds” festival for Martin Randall Travel.</p>
        <p>In his spare time, Matthew is a keen photographer and follower of wildlife conservation. He lives with his wife and daughter near Brighton, UK.</p>

          "How exciting to be returning for a third year at CRMSS! It has been a pleasure to see the positive evolution over the last two years and this year's course looks to be heading in new directions once again with the vastly experienced and inimitable Robert Hollingworth as CRMSS Guest Artist. I am looking forward to CRMSS 2020 immensely and am excited to work with more singers on issues relating to solo singing and performance, focussing on the sort of healthy, full, and connected singing which should be no barrier to working well within an ensemble, no matter what the repertoire might be."

          Lucas Harris discovered the lute during his undergraduate studies at Pomona College, where he graduated summa
          cum laude. He then studied early music in Italy at the Civica scuola di musica di Milano (as a scholar of the
          Marco Fodella Foundation) and then in Germany at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen. After several years in New
          York City, he moved to Toronto in 2004 and became the regular lutenist for the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra.
          He is a founding member of the Toronto Continuo Collective, the Vesuvius Ensemble, and the Lute Legends

          completed graduate studies in choral conducting at the University of Toronto, the degree having been funded by
          a prestigious SSHRC research grant not often awarded to performers. Upon graduating, Lucas was chosen as the

          concert programs. He has also directed projects for the Pacific Baroque Orchestra, the Ohio State University

          humaines in Montréal: “The revelation of the concert was the Torontonian lutenist Lucas Harris, who weaved a
          poetic thread through his infinitely subtle interventions. The sweetness and patience of his playing . . . was

          enthusiasm we had for the cancelled CRMSS 2020 will be channelled straight into making CRMSS 2021 the best
          Renaissance workshop North America has ever seen. I’m especially excited that we’re moving forward with
          incorporating a LUTE mini-workshop into CRMSS. As the world emerges from this pandemic, people will need to
          find joy and love through listening to live music, and I’d like us musicians to be ready to deliver that. I
          can’t wait to see you there!"

          introduction of the <b>CRMSS International
            Scholars</b> programme. Each year, we will welcome a group of student singers from outside Canada, starting
          with the United Kingdom. They will come as a pre-formed group, who know one
          another and have worked together before, and will share their talents and experience with the rest of the
          CRMSS participants over the course of the week. They will act as leaders within the larger singing groups, and
          participate in the small
          group sessions in amongst the Canadian participants, as well as have some time to rehearse on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, we are pleased to welcome all five current students studying for a master's degree in Music at the
          University of York, in the UK, enrolled in York's "Solo Voice Ensemble Singing" MA pathway (known as SVES).
          This is a course of performance-based master's level study dedicated entirely to one-per-part ensemble
          singing. The programme lasts one year and includes daily rehearsing and coaching, three major recitals, and
          opportunities to perform with all of the University of York's many other singing groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on SVES, please have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/ma-music-solo-voice-ensemble-singing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">University

          Cathedral, where she was the first female choral scholar. With the cathedral choirs, she was lucky enough to
          perform in some of Europe’s most prestigious venues. Anna developed a love of choral music as a member of the
          National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, having grown up through their programme of choirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Ed</b> started out his singing as a chorister at York Minster at age seven, which led to him exploring
          music from an early age. Following five years in York and a music scholarship at Oakham School, he
          then went on to become a Choral Scholar at Portsmouth Cathedral. He has recently graduated from
          the university of York in 2020 with an Upper Second-Class degree in Music. Whilst an undergraduate,
          he has had many varied vocal opportunities, including singing with The 24, the university acapella
          ensemble Vox and external choirs such as The Swan Consort, The Damian Singers, The Ebor Singers
          and The Chapter House Choir. Alongside singing with these choirs Ed has worked with Convivium
          Records on a tour to the Tolosa International Choral Festival in 2018 and recording works by Hugh
          Benham for an album in 2019 and sung at the Northern Aldbrough Opera Festival in a production of
          Handel’s musical drama Semele alongside artists from Opera North. Ed decided to continue his
          studies on the Solo Voice Ensemble Singing MA after his voice naturally moved from Baritone to
          Tenor through the coaching and guidance of his current teacher Susan Young. Alongside being on
          the SVES MA, he is the tenor choral scholar at York Minster.
