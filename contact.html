  Applications for CRMSS 2021 are now open. The application process has two
  parts:
</p>
<ul class="contact-ul">
  <li>filling in an online form</li>
  <li>uploading some supporting material</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can do all of this online by using the buttons above. Please do fill in
  the online form as soon as you can, so we can get in contact with you and help
  you through the rest of the process. You don't need to upload your supporting
  material at the same time as you fill in the form.
</p>
<p>
  The application deadline of <b>July 1st, 2021</b> only applies to the
  submission of the online form. If you do this in the last few days of June
  2021, you may submit your supporting material in the early part of July 2021.
  We will contact you and make sure everything goes smoothly with your
  application.
</p>
<p>
  Participants of CRMSS 2018 or CRMSS 2019, or those who applied for CRMSS 2020
  before it was cancelled, will not need to resubmit supporting material and
  will complete a shorter application form.
</p>
<p>
  We are using a Google Form to collect applications and Dropbox to collect your
  supporting material. For those of you submitting this material, we need two
  recordings of you singing and two letters of reference. Don't worry! The
  recordings don't need to be professionally made and don't require
  accompaniment. You may submit video or audio files. If you already have a
  recording of yourself that you like (perhaps something made over the last year
  in lockdown?), please submit that, but we'll need to hear two pieces in total.
  The two letters of reference should come from a conductor, singing teacher, or
  other musician in your life who knows you and who can give us an idea of your
  ability and experience.
</p>
<p>
  Click on the 'Apply to the Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School 2021'
  button below, and our online application form will open in a new browser tab.
  You can then give us all the information we need and submit your application.
</p>
<p>
  The 'Upload your supporting material' button takes you to a CRMSS Dropbox
  upload page, where you can directly upload your recordings and letters of
  reference. Other people may upload material on your behalf (teachers,
  conductors, etc).
