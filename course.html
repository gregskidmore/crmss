<h3>CRMSS 2021 Theme</h3>
<p>The theme of CRMSS 2021 is <i>Josquin 500: Beyond the Ordinary</i>.</p>
<p>
  'Beyond the ordinary' is a poetic translation of the opening line of 'Praeter rerum seriem', a medieval
  plainsong hymn. In the pre-Tridentine rite, this hymn was sung at Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Josquin des
  Prez, who many consider to be the father of Renaissance polyphony and who died 500 years ago this year, wrote a
  wonderful six-voice setting of this text, using the Gregorian melody as a cantus firmus. The piece became hugely
  famous in his own lifetime.</p>
<p>
  Two of Josquin's leading successors, Cipriano de Rore and Orlande de Lassus, found inspiration in this motet and
  honoured it in their own writing using so-called 'parody' technique, the practice of borrowing melodies,
  textures, or moods from one piece to provide the framework for another - 'riffing', essentially. Lassus wrote a
  Magnificat setting in this way based on Josquin's motet. Rore wrote an entire <i>Missa Praeter rerum seriem</i>,
  considered a monumental achievement of the entire 16th century, for seven voices.
</p>
<p>
  At CRMSS 2021, we will perform all three of these magnetic, captivating, powerful, and mysterious pieces. This
  theme also allows us the opportunity of exploring the music of Josquin's contemporaries, those who influenced
  him, and the generations of later composers upon whom he had such an impact. Broadly speaking, we will open out
  from just looking at Josquin, Rore, and Lassus, and explore as much of the Franco-Flemish musical style as we
  can, though these three men were among its leading standard bearers for more than 150 years. As always, we will
  cover as much of the varied music written over the vast era we call 'The Renaissance' as we can, focussing
  ourselves on music connected with the Low Countries and northern France. This area, the 'cradle of polyphony'
  offers us so much.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Beyond the Ordinary</i> also speaks of the wider ambitions of our experience together at CRMSS. We explore
  the unusual, the powerful, the challenging, and we seek out the intensity of Renaissance polyphonic music in all
  its richness. This music is not 'ordinary' or 'normal' or even 'comfortable'. It is fascinating, enthralling,
  and - very literally - extraordinary! We hope you will come away from CRMSS with an understanding of this music
  as being alive, vivid, and powerful, and well 'beyond the ordinary'.
</p>

<h3>
  What types of singing happens at CRMSS?
</h3>

<h3>Choral</h3>
<p>
  A major focus of the week's work will be singing together as one chamber-choir sized ensemble, exploring larger
  scale, mainly sacred a capella music of the Renaissance. The specific repertoire chosen will depend on the
  distribution of voices amongst the
  course participants, and the repertoire selections will conform with the theme of this year's course.
</p>
<p>
  We will also divide the participants into two smaller chamber groups which will work separately, as well as the
  tutti singing we will do together.
</p>

<h3>Solo</h3>
<p>
  While the majority of our time will be spent preparing ensemble music in choral and small group contexts, good
  solo vocal technique is of course essential for good singing. This applies to music written in any style and
  from any time period. While Greg will conduct the full group in choral sessions each day, Emily Atkinson and
  Andrew Pickett will provide solo singing tuition for all the course participants as
  well.
</p>

<!--
  <p>
        For those who wish to pursue solo singing further, Matthew will be in charge of arranging specialist solo coaching sessions throughout the week.
  </p>
-->

<p>Participants are enthusiastically encouraged to bring their own solo repertoire, and we suggest works written
  before 1650.</p>

<h3>Consort singing: one and two per part vocal chamber music</h3>
<p>
  Any serious amount of time spent getting to know the music of the Renaissance must include small-ensemble
  singing. The tutors will choose groups and assign them repertoire before the week begins, sending out scores and
  reference recordings so participants
  can prepare and come with at least one or two pieces already learned. Over the course of the week, it is hoped
  that other groups will form ad hoc to explore this wonderful secular and domestic devotional repertoire,
  sometimes forgotten when thinking
  of vocal music from the Renaissance. It is of particular importance that the secular music of this period be
  covered, as it provides such a vivid picture of the sorts of musical lives the musicians of the time actually
  lived, be they composers
  or singers or both.
</p>

<p>
  As with solo repertoire, there will be opportunities to work on small ensemble music you might bring yourself.
</p>

<p>
  In a change from CRMSS 2019, the pre-formed small groups will all be at least two-per-part. Everyone will be
  allocated into one of these small groups. There will be more time set aside for even smaller, one-per-part
  consorts to form and experiment with other repertoire, both on an ad hoc basis and also under the direction of
  the tutors.
</p>

<h3>Final course concert</h3>
<p>
  The work we do over the course of the week will lead us to a major public concert performance. Arrangements for
  this concert are in the planning stages, but it will take place on the evening of <b>Friday, September 3rd.</b>
</p>

<!--
  <p>
    This year we are excited to be able to present this event in the wonderful acoustic of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cathedral.dol.ca/">St Peter's Cathedral Basilica</a> in downtown London, Ontario. This is one of London's premier concert venues and is particularly well suited to choral singing.
  </p>
-->

<h3>Choral Vespers at St Peter's Seminary</h3>
<p>
  At CRMSS 2019, a definite highlight for everyone was the special privilege of singing a Choral Vespers service
  in one of London Ontario's truly magnificent and rarely enjoyed liturgical spaces - the St. Thomas Aquinas
  Chapel at St Peter's Seminary. Plans to repeat this in 2021 are ongoing, and we hope to have some exciting news
  regarding this event soon.
</p>

<!-- 
  <p>
    We are excited to repeat this in 2020, as we will present another of these wonderful Roman Catholic choral services entirely 
    in Latin and following the pre-Vatican II rite found in the <i>Liber Usualis</i>.
  </p>
-->

<!--
  <p>
    This service will take place on <b>Thursday, May 14th 2020, starting at 5:30pm.</b> It will be free and open to
    the public.
  </p>
-->

<!--

<h3>Daily evening services at Huron University College</h3>
<p>Throughout the week, at the end of each day, we will sing Compline in the <b>Chapel of Huron University
    College</b>. These services will begin at <b>9pm</b> each day. Our Compline is simple and largely made up
  plainsong, with a few simple motets for contrast, and is designed not as a crescendo to our day, but as a way of
  bringing it to a close - as the service was designed to do monastically. While these services will be open to
  the public, they will mainly serve
  as a way for us to come together as as course and to experience the daily rhythm of liturgical music making that
  formed the wider context for most of the music we will be studying.
</p>

-->

<h3>Informal 'sharing' concert for CRMSS participants and invited guests</h3>
<p>In a major change from our 2018 and 2019 courses, everyone who participates at CRMSS in 2021 will have a chance
  to perform any of the music they work on over the week that they wish to, be it in their preformed smaller
  groups or in groups they form themselves or their solo repertoire they've worked on or music they
  bring themselves... or anything else! On the evening of <b>Thursday, September 2nd</b>, we will hold a major
  performance event as a culmination of our week together, to be attended by the course as a whole and some
  specially invited guests. This event will also be catered such that we hope it will gradually turn into a party,
  as food and drink are consumed and performances become more light-hearted, tutors are encouraged to do silly
  things on stage, etc.
</p>
<p>
  While the public concert on Friday the 3rd will focus on our tutti core course repertoire as an offering for
  the wider public, as well as showcase a bit of the rest of what we do on the course, we won't be able to fit in
  everything. This event on the Thursday evening will be open ended and for everyone. We can't wait to see what
  you all come up with!
</p>

<h2 id="typical-day">A Typical Day</h2>
<a class="back-to-top" onclick="javascript:ScrollToTop();">Back to top</a>
<p>
  In a response to feedback from participants from our 2018 and 2019 courses, the schedule in 2021 will be
  overhauled. There will be much more time to eat, rest, form small ad hoc groups, practice on your own, etc.
  Here's the shape of how 'a typical' day will look.

<!-- <h3>
  Soft launch
</h3>
<p>
  New for CRMSS 2021 will be a 'soft launch' to the week. The course will begin on the afternoon of Thursday,
  August 26th with a longer registration period and time for you to find your feet in our venues. The singing that
  day will only consist of a tutti rehearsal, followed by wine and nibbles (that might perhaps extend into
  the evening!). More information on this 'soft launch' will be available soon.
</p> -->

<h3>
  A more relaxed pace
</h3>
<p>
  Attendance at Compline will not be compulsory, but is greatly encouraged! The feedback we've received from those
  who did attend every night in
  previous years has been that it is a wonderful way to bring each day to a close, but we also understand that
  some of you may need your sleep!
</p>
<p>
  Attendance at the talks will also not be compulsory, but encouraged - if for no other reason than to give your
  voice a break and get your brain thinking about something other than all that sight reading.
</p>
<p>
  We are also planning on using our venues more efficiently and factoring in more time to move between sessions so
  travel time is minimised and less singing time is wasted!
</p>

<h3>
  ... and an afternoon off!
</h3>
<p>
  In another change from 2018 and 2019, we will plan an entire afternoon off during the week once things have got
  going. This will allow the course as a whole to go somewhere off campus and do something non-musical together -
  to have some fun as a group and get to know one another! We are looking at minigolf or laser tag or even just a
  picnic in the park. Those plans are not finalised, and we'll update you once the final course scheduling has
  been completed in the summer. The idea will be to relax for an afternoon and recharge for the rest of the week's
  intense singing.</p>
<p>
  We have heard your feedback about the pace of the week and are determined to find a good balance.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="lectures">Lectures, Symposia, and Round Table discussions</h2>
<a class="back-to-top" onclick="javascript:ScrollToTop();">Back to top</a>
<p>The course will include some sessions in which we - don't - sing! These discussions will provide context for
  the practical music making which is the focus of the course, and highlight the importance of scholarship in
  performance, and, crucially, visa versa.</p>
<p>
  So far at CRMSS, the following talks have taken place:
<ul class="lectureslist">
  <li><b>Dr. Roseen Giles</b> gave a paper entitled “‘Don't worry, this will sing itself', and other musical
    fictions" about the practice of <i>musica ficta</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Andrew Pickett</b> presented “‘Drop the beat’ - Introduction to the theory and practice of vocal ensemble
    intonation”.</li>
  <li><b>Dr. Kate Helsen</b> introduced us to some of her fascinating new research in “What's in a Riff - Chant
    DNA in modal polyphony”.</li>
  <li><b>Greg Skidmore, Matt Long, and Emily Atkinson</b> took part in a round table discussion led by Dr. Giles
    entitled “Being a Professional Singer in the UK”, taking questions on every aspect of their professional lives
    in the UK.</li>
  <li><b>Lucas Harris</b> gave a lecture entitled “Musica Transalpina: The madrigal in Italy &amp; England, c1600”
  </li>
  <li><b>Dr. Kate Helsen</b> gave us a crash course in Renaissance musical notation with her workshop entitled
    “Partly Useful: Renaissance notation”</li>
  <li><b>Dr. Troy Ducharme</b> of the Don Wright Faculty of Music at Western University wrapped our heads around
    Gesualdo's wild sounds with “Beyond Rules: Counterpoint Technique, Musical Meaning, and Style in Selected
    Works of Gesualdo.”</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  For CRMSS 2021 we are still finalising our programme of talks and lectures. As these become finalised, we will post more information here.
