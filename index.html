<p>
  The fourth annual Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, directed by Greg Skidmore with Guest Artist Robert Hollingworth, will take place in
  <b>May 2022</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at undergraduate students, graduates, and young professional musicians, The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School (CRMSS)
  is dedicated to the study and performance of Renaissance polyphonic vocal and instrumental music at the highest levels.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  Come and learn from internationally acknowledged specialist tutors from the worlds of performance and academia, and be immersed in this magnificent music for a
  week. It will be an intensive period of rehearsal and performance, both liturgically and in concert, all with an emphasis on quality in performance.
</p>

  <!-- <p>
    Applications are not yet open, as we are still finalising our plans for 2022. Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you would like any more information.
  </p> -->

  <p>
    Applications for CRMSS 2022 are open! Please click
    <a href="/apply">here</a> to go to the Contact page of this website where you can apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you wish, you can also chat live with us via Facebook Messenger by clicking the red button in the bottom right corner of any page on this website. If we're
    not available immediately, we will get back to you as soon as we can.
  </p>

  <p>The application deadline is Wednesday, February 1st, 2022.</p>

  <p>
    While the course is open to everyone aged 18 and over, successful applicants will have a high level of sight reading confidence and some experience with small
    ensemble and, for singers, one per part a capella singing. Current and recent university music students are especially encouraged to apply and some familiarity
    with Renaissance repertoire will also be an asset. We encourage everyone to apply, though; a major in vocal studies is not a requirement, nor is the completion
    of formal musicological study.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course will be very heavily focussed on performance; we will encounter academic, liturgical, and stylistic questions primarily through our practical
    engagement with the music itself. All that is required is an open mind and an affinity for collaborative ensemble music making.

    <h3>FOR MUSIC STUDENTS AT WESTERN UNIVERSITY ONLY</h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/"><img src="/img/westernlogo2.png" id="western-academic-credit-logo"></a>
    We are excited to offer CRMSS participants who are also registered as undergraduate students at the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/">Don Wright Faculty of Music at Western University</a>
    a chance to earn an Experiential Learning half credit by attending CRMSS 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those seeking to gain undergraduate academic credit for their time at CRMSS will participate in the same events and have the same opportunities as the rest of
    the participants, and their CRMSS course fee will be the same (see below). However, in order to gain the half credit, they will need to get pre-approval before
    the summer school begins from
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/john-cuciurean.html">Dr. J. Cuciurean, Associate Dean (Academic Programs and Admissions)</a>, who will
    provide additional details upon application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eligible students will need to complete and submit some written work. Any interested participants must contact Dr. Cuciurean for more information
    <b><u>before</u></b> CRMSS 2021 begins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate music students at Western are also encouraged to contact
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/catherine-nolan.html">Catherine Nolan, Associate Dean (Graduate Studies)</a>
    for more information on obtaining credit by attending CRMSS 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    This partnership validates our strong academic credentials at The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, while also highlighting the crucial roles rehearsal
    and performance, both in a liturgical context and in concert, play in the study of music from the past. We are excited to welcome Western students onto the
    course in 2021!

  <h3>Final course concert</h3>
  <p>
    We are extraordinarily privileged to be giving our final course concert in the magnificent chapel of St Peter's Seminary. This concert will be open to the public
    and will take place at <b>2:30pm</b> on <b>Sunday, May 29</b>. The concert will include a selection of the music we've learned over the course of the week,
    including chamber choir, tutti, small group, and solo selections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tickets are free of charge, but you need to reserve your place in advance. Please fill in this online form:
    <a href="https://crmss.org/tickets-2022">CRMSS 2022 Tickets</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Choral Vespers at St Peter's Seminary</h3>
  <p>
    At CRMSS 2019, a definite highlight for everyone was the special privilege of singing a Choral Vespers service in one of London Ontario's truly magnificent and
    rarely enjoyed liturgical spaces - the St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel at St Peter's Seminary. We are delighted to confirm that in 2022 we will again sing Choral
    Vespers at St Peter's Seminary, at <b>7:00pm</b> on <b>Saturday, May 28</b>.
  </p>
  <p>This church service will be open to the public.</p>
  <p>
    There is no charge to attend this public Catholic church service, but you need to reserve your place in advance. Please fill in this online form:
    <a href="https://crmss.org/tickets-2022">CRMSS 2022 Tickets</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Daily evening church services</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout the week, at the end of each day, we will sing Compline. These services will begin at <b>9pm</b> each day. Our Compline service is simple and largely
    made up of plainsong, with a few simple motets for contrast, and is designed not as something pressured or necessarily to be worked towards, but rather as a way
    of bringing our day together to a peaceful close - precisely as the service was designed to do in its original monastic context. These services will mainly serve
    as a way for us to come together as as course and to experience the daily rhythm of liturgical music making that formed the wider context for most of the music
    we will be studying.
  </p>
  <p>Our nightly Compline services are open to public attendance.</p>

  <h3>Cost</h3>
  <p>The course fee for CRMSS 2022 is <b>$525</b>.</p>
  <p>
    We pride ourselves on keeping the fee absolutely as low as possible while offering a world-class experience. Your fee covers more than 35 hours of ensemble and
    individual coaching over the course of 8 days, participation in lectures and panel discussions led by our resident musicologist tutors, attendance and
    participation in masterclasses, private recitals, church services, and public concerts as well as musical scores (many of which will be newly edited) which are
    yours to keep after the course finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Successful applicants will be asked to provide a deposit before the course begins to secure their place of <b>$200</b>. This will be counted against the total
    course fee, the remainder of which will be due later. Once fees are paid, CRMSS reserves the right to limit any refund, taking into account the individual
    circumstances of a participant's cancellation.
