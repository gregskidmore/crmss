<p>
  The fourth annual Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, directed by Greg Skidmore with Guest Artist Robert Hollingworth, will take place in
  <b>May 2022</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at undergraduate students, graduates, and young professional musicians, The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School (CRMSS)
  is dedicated to the study and performance of Renaissance polyphonic vocal and instrumental music at the highest levels.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  Come and learn from internationally acknowledged specialist tutors from the worlds of performance and academia, and be immersed in this magnificent music for a
  week. It will be an intensive period of rehearsal and performance, both liturgically and in concert, all with an emphasis on quality in performance.
</p>

  <!-- <p>
    Applications are not yet open, as we are still finalising our plans for 2022. Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you would like any more information.
  </p> -->

  <p>
    Applications for CRMSS 2021 are open! Please click
    <a href="/apply">here</a> to go to the Contact page of this website where you can apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you wish, you can also chat live with us via Facebook Messenger by clicking the red button in the bottom right corner of any page on this website. If we're
    not available immediately, we will get back to you as soon as we can.
  </p>

  <p>The application deadline is Wednesday, February 1st, 2022.</p>

  <p>
    While the course is open to everyone aged 18 and over, successful applicants will have a high level of sight reading confidence and some experience with small
    ensemble and, for singers, one per part a capella singing. Current and recent university music students are especially encouraged to apply and some familiarity
    with Renaissance repertoire will also be an asset. We encourage everyone to apply, though; a major in vocal studies is not a requirement, nor is the completion
    of formal musicological study.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course will be very heavily focussed on performance; we will encounter academic, liturgical, and stylistic questions primarily through our practical
    engagement with the music itself. All that is required is an open mind and an affinity for collaborative ensemble music making.

    <h3>FOR MUSIC STUDENTS AT WESTERN UNIVERSITY ONLY</h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/"><img src="/img/westernlogo2.png" id="western-academic-credit-logo"></a>
    We are excited to offer CRMSS participants who are also registered as undergraduate students at the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/">Don Wright Faculty of Music at Western University</a>
    a chance to earn an Experiential Learning half credit by attending CRMSS 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those seeking to gain undergraduate academic credit for their time at CRMSS will participate in the same events and have the same opportunities as the rest of
    the participants, and their CRMSS course fee will be the same (see below). However, in order to gain the half credit, they will need to get pre-approval before
    the summer school begins from
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/john-cuciurean.html">Dr. J. Cuciurean, Associate Dean (Academic Programs and Admissions)</a>, who will
    provide additional details upon application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eligible students will need to complete and submit some written work. Any interested participants must contact Dr. Cuciurean for more information
    <b><u>before</u></b> CRMSS 2021 begins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate music students at Western are also encouraged to contact
    <a target="_blank" href="https://music.uwo.ca/faculty/bios/catherine-nolan.html">Catherine Nolan, Associate Dean (Graduate Studies)</a>
    for more information on obtaining credit by attending CRMSS 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    This partnership validates our strong academic credentials at The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School, while also highlighting the crucial roles rehearsal
    and performance, both in a liturgical context and in concert, play in the study of music from the past. We are excited to welcome Western students onto the
    course in 2021!

  <h3>Cost</h3>
  <p>The course fee for CRMSS 2022 is <b>$525</b>.</p>
  <p>
    We pride ourselves on keeping the fee absolutely as low as possible while offering a world-class experience. Your fee covers more than 35 hours of ensemble and
    individual coaching over the course of 8 days, participation in lectures and panel discussions led by our resident musicologist tutors, attendance and
    participation in masterclasses, private recitals, church services, and public concerts as well as musical scores (many of which will be newly edited) which are
    yours to keep after the course finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Successful applicants will be asked to provide a deposit before the course begins to secure their place of $200. This will be counted against the total course
    fee, the remainder of which will be due later. Once fees are paid, CRMSS reserves the right to limit any refund, taking into account the individual circumstances
    of a participant's cancellation.
  </p>

  <p>
