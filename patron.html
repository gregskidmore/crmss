    The Canadian Renaissance Music Summer School continues to grow!</p>
  <p>
    After another successful course in May 2019, the last few months have seen Greg working hard behind the scenes to
    put CRMSS on a firmer footing for the long term and I have followed his progress closely.
  </p>
  <p>
    CRMSS is now a federally registered non profit organisation in Canada, and a Board of Directors has been appointed.
    This represents Greg’s commitment to making CRMSS thrive in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Greg and I have regularly discussed his long term plans for the course (on one notable occasion late into the night
    in Àvila, Spain, in the shadow of the cathedral where Tomas Luis de Victoria was a boy chorister) and his passion
    and determination to
    get this right; stand up for the music we both love; and bring its joy and power to Canadian singers is a delight to
    see.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think some of the changes planned for 2020, the course’s third year, are big steps in the right direction: forging
    links with UK-based students, bringing in more tutors, and a tighter repertoire focus. For those who have been to
    CRMSS before, you will
    notice improvements. If you haven’t been able to attend so far, now is your chance!
  </p>
  <p>
    It was during the third year of the summer course I used to run with other members of The Tallis Scholars, held in a
    small town in England, where Greg and I first met. He impressed me then as an energetic, if slightly mad,
    18-year-old Renaissance polyphony
    zealot, and over the years he has become a valued contributor to the world of this music. With CRMSS, Greg continues
    to fly the flag for Renaissance music in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a great pleasure to continue to support CRMSS.
  </p>
